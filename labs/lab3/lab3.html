			As someone who dabbles in to development be it in software or web, I cannot stress enough the value of the following resources. These three things (though not limited to) are one of the most important resources for anyone who has done or wants to do any sort of web or app development.

			They are, of course, <em>source control</em>, <em>code editor</em>, and <em>documentation</em>. <strong>Source control</strong> <em>(aka version control)</em> ensures smooth collaboration with multiple developers working on a project. It helps keep track of changes to code and assets as well as making it posible to revert changes and track who is contributing what chagnes. <em>Git</em> and <em>SVN</em> are examples of version control systems. <strong>Documentations</strong> provide invaluable information and resouces about a particular software development kit, API, scripting language, dev tool, etc. They also provide code samples and examples, offer code snippits to be used in your own work, and provide technical details for the products. A <strong>code editor</strong> is at the heart of software and web development. Many popular standalone code editors exist. Although much less powerfull than a full IDE (integrated development environment) such as Eclipse and Visual Studio, these lightweight yet versatile apps' usefullness scale from individual developers to enterprise class dev teams. And, of course, a code editor is a main component of IDEs themselves!

		<p>The following are a great example of a code editor, technical software documentation, and online git version control repository, respectively</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" style= "color:lightblue" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/" style="color:lightblue" target="_blank">Microsoft Docs</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/" style="color:lightblue" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>P.S. Honorable mention goes to <strong>"<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" style="color:lightblue; text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>"</strong> for featured code editor. It was hard to choose between the two. Notepad++ is more general purpose but still powerful for working with code and text. It may even be more preferrable for casual users working with text or code files due to its simplicity. Whie they both have their pros and cons, you can't go wrong either way.</p>
