			<p>The purpose of this lab is to help with the initial brainstorming ideas for <a href="#">Project 1</a> of the CMWEB 120 web development course. The projects for this course centers around building a website for a client, with the first of the two—Project 1—involving working with the aforementioned client to create a project management plan for creating the site.</p>
		<!--/📢 Content Intro-->
		</div>


		<!--📑 Main Content 📑-->

		<h2>Potential Clients</h2>

		<p>It must be stressed that the project requires working with actual clients rather than a hypothetical one. Of course, I would be doing it as volunteer work for this course instead of entering into a business contract. Nonetheless, the objective is to develop the skills around project management and working with stakeholders to deliver the end product. These same skills should, then, be applicable when taking on real-world web development projects and contracts in the future.</p>

		<p>Let me, first, list some of the persons I had in mind, which I'll elaborate on a bit below, Insha'Allah.
			
			<img src="assets/graphics/project.svg"
				 alt="Generic clipart of a desk with items on it."
				 class="image-wrap-right" >
			
			<ol>
				<li>My friend for his photography</li>
				<li>My cousin for his portfolio</li>
				<li>Another friend for his transit related YouTube channel</li>
				<li><s>An actual client</s> (out of scipe); more on that below.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h3>Photography and YouTube</h3>

		<p>The first person I listed above is a friend who I've known for several years and currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Though not currently pursuing it on a professional level, his passion for photography is undeniable. In fact, I have featured some of his photographs, with his permission, on lab 5 and Project 2 of my CMWEB 110 student site. Currently he is documenting, via photography, the construction of two major transit infrastructure projects that are currently on-going in the city of Montreal. I was thinking about designing for him a website where I could compile his photos documenting each for the two projects and show the evolution of the work that have occured over the last several months.</p>

		<p>My other potential client is also a friend who lives in Canada, and he runs a YouTube channel where he films various mass transit--subways, busses, trains--in various cities of Canada.</p>

		<h3>Creating a Portfolio</h3>
		
		<p>I also listed my cousin as a potential client. Given that he is currenly in his final year of his engineering undergraduate program, I considered this would a great time to create for him a portfolio detailing his previous work and interests in the field as he nears the completion of his degree.</p>
		
		<h3>About the Actual Client</h3>
		<img src="assets/graphics/laptop.svg"
			 alt="Laptop and a calculator"
			 class="center-image" >
		
		<p>It just so happens that around the same time as I began working on this project, I was contacted via email by an actual client who wanted me to build a website for their used car dealership. However, after going over his requirements, such as a dynamic online inventory listing, having the occational blog posts for announcements, it quickly became apparent that his solution requires the use of a content management system (CMS) such as WordPress and plugins such as WooCommerce, which is beyond the scope of this course (where I am to write simple HTML pages by hand and without  making use of server-side scripting and tools like a CMS). <a href="https://autofalcon.ca/" target="_blank">You can view the work in progress website here.</a></p>
		
		<p>That being said, I still felt this was worth mentioning here becase even though this client isn't part of this project directly, the proejct management skills I build here is something I am looking forward to implimenting as I work on designing his website--such as making use of project milestones, for example.</p>
		
		<h2>Initial Questions for the Client</h2>
		<p>Ultimately I have decided to go ahead with selecting my friend as my client, as he was open to the idea and already familiar with my web development courses, since I had already approached him earlier with regards to some of the CMWEB 110 work in the previous semester.</p>
		
		<p>Here are some of the initial questions I had in mind for my first meeting with my friend.
			
		<img src="assets/graphics/bulb.svg"
			 alt="lightbulb"
			 class="image-wrap-right" >
			
			<ul>
				<li>Do you want me to theme your site in dark mode or light mode?</li>
				<li>How would you like me to present your photographs documenting the two transit projects?</li>
				<li>Do you want to present the images only visually or do you want to add text--as in a form of blog post describing each of the projects?</li>
				<li>What kind of logo do you want for the site?</li>
				<li>Do you want me to add links to your social media pages such as Twitter, YouTube, and/or Facebook?</li>
			</ul></p>
		
		<h2>My Workbench</h2>
		<p>Let's talk about the tools. In designing websites, and anything digital, really, I have come to rely on a variety of tools over the years. Some I have depended on to this day while others have been superseded by newer tools which themselves may have since been replaced. I want to briefly go over a few of these tools here.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Adobe Dreamweaver/VS Code:</strong> When it comes to web development, where we are working with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>PHP</b> documents, finding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor" target="_blank">code editor</a> that one is comfortable with is crucial. My code editor of choice for general purposes is <em>Visual Studio Code</em>, but for web development I always find myself coming back to <em>Adobe Dreamweaver</em>. Dreamweaver combines a rich code editor with tools that help make things efficient and speed up my workflow. To be clear, I still write every part of the web pages, from top to bottom, by hand (rather than using the "point & click" WYSIWYG designer that Dreamweaver offers), but tools like an integrated FTP manager and versioning make it invaluable.</li>
			
			<li><strong>HTML Validation Tool:</strong> Tools like w3c validator is essential to ensuring that the webpages I design properly written based on the current web standards and to also catch common minor mistakes that I may have overlooked, like forgetting to close one of the div tags, for example. The tool I rely on most for validating my document is the built-in validator in Dreamweaver, which, as I write my code,l the IDE will have a green checkmark on its status bar when my HTML is valid and a red x when it is not. Having this in real-time is immensely helpful.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Reference Materials:</strong> It is frustrating to run into roadblocks while I write my HTML documents and design them with CSS. At the same time, the satisfaction of overcoming those roadblocks makes it all worth it every time. When I do get stuck, reference materials such as YouTube videos, "Stack Overflow" website, and even the textbook for this course, "Learning Web Design 5th Edition" become invaluable. Without these, I could not have attained nearly the quality of my web pages that I aim for when building this student site. I had no prior experience in writing HTML and CSS before CMWEB 110, and reference materials such as these are to be thanked for allowing me to apply my creativity and explore my curiosity with designing these pages.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Graphics and images:</strong> Visual presentation is a big part of building great websites. But copyright isn't something to gloss over. Thankfully the Montreal-based website <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplashe.com</a> offers hundreds, if not thousands, of beautiful, high resolution, images that allow us to use in our projects, commercial and non-commercial, without any Copyright restrictions. Another tool I use is Microsoft Office 365, which provides high-quality SVG graphics for use in our work. In fact, the SVG graphics used on this page are brought to you by Microsoft Office 365</li>
			
			<li><strong>Let's not forget the web browsers:</strong> Honorable mention goes to the web browsers that render these pages. While not something I rely on regularly at the moment, features such as "inspect element" that browsers offer are something I see becoming more critical as I dive into more complex web projects that involve scripting and embedding code down the line.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>The Road Ahead and Looking back</h2>
		<p>The road ahead will be challenging, especially given my time constraints. But I like a good challenge, especially when it comes to doing something I love, like web design! I want to come back to this page and summarize my thoughts on the project. I plan to update this page to include it here, Insha'Allah. So stay tuned.</p>
