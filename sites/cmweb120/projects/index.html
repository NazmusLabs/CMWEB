        <p style="padding-top: .5em">The final part of CMWEB 120 Project 1 is the alpha site, which is the prototype template for the client website that is built for Project 2.</p>

        <h3>If you were to create another real site, is there anything you would do differently, based on this experience?</h3>
        <p>For the time being, I don't think I would radically change the approach from the one I have taken to do this project. This is because, through this project, I have already learned a lot about efficiently organizing a project plan. So rather than drastically change things or trying even more new concepts, I believe I first need to refine what I have learned here and continued with this approach for the next few website design projects that I may have. This will allow me to better solidify the concepts I have learned and find ways to refine and tweak my approach. And once I am comfortable using this template, I would try adding or changing things.</p>
        <h3>What did you learn about working with clients?</h3>
        <p>If I must be honest, I guess I can say I was one of those who thought planning prototyping designs was "a waste of time". Conceptually, to me, it appeared as though I would be more efficient by jumping straight into building the website. In my mind, I knew what I was trying to make and the design I wanted to apply; so why to bother prototyping or documenting. I could not be more wrong. I am genuinely amazed at how much more efficient I was at designing the website for this project after I created the prototypes. It surprised me because I knew what design I wanted to go with; but even so, having a prototype, a wireframe, that I could refer to as I built the site was invaluable. Furthermore, though it might sound obvious in hindsight, it is MUCH easier to tweak the design of a prototype in a graphics program rather than a live HTML/CSS code. (Drastically trying to tweak existing CSS has caused nightmare scenarios, in the past, mildly speaking...especially since I am completely new at this).</p>
        <h3>Would you follow this same procedure for future web projects?</h3>
        <p>Yes, absolutely. As I mentioned in my response to the first question, my focus is to continue using what I have learned and make minor refinements for the next few projects until these concepts become second nature to me.</p>
        <h3>Did you share the site with your client, yet? What was their response?</h3>
        <p>Yes. In fact, my friend--who was the client for this project, and I have collaborated in real-time as I built the website. We have been speaking via IM, and my friend would give me feedback regularly on how I could tweak the site as I built it. Obviously, this kind of real-time communication and feedback won't be typical for future clients but having a friend as a client helps. And I will take what I can get :)</p>

💡 Terminology 
----------------
Daisy: the term "Daisy" may be used to indicate the client device that is rendering the webpage. E.g. files stored on "Daisy” vs files stored on server”.

It may be used in names of variables that relate specefically to the end-device. For instance, a variable that holds the content to be read aloud by the device may have "Daisy" in its name (as in “Daisy” will speak the following text).

Other examples: "Daisy set to silent", "Daisy on airplane mode", "Daisy will execute this javascript if...", etc.
