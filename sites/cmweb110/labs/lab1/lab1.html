    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>

    <h2>How are you doing?</h2>
    <p>Hey, there! Thanks for visiting this web page. My name is Nazmus Shakib Khandaker, and I
    have manually written this html webpage using nothing but a text editor and my trusty old
    keyboard. If you happen to stumble upon this page, I invite you to view the page source and
    see the html I wrote and copy or use it to your heart's content.</p>

    <!-- So, you are viewing the source, huh? Well, glad you did; so make yourself at home. By
    the way, I have decided to use VS Code as the text editor to type this, and now I know why
    people are so in love with this editor! What is your favorite text editor? Me, personally,
    don't have a favorite, per say. I really like VS Code, but sometime, I just need to type
    something quickly, and notepad.exe does that job pretty well! :) -->

    <h2>The Mighty Sentence</h2>
    <p>"The big brown fox jumped over a lazy dog." That's the infamous sentence. It's a sentence
    that has all the letter of the alphabet. Creazy, I know! But apparently, people use them to
    preview different type faces as this one sentence is all that is needed to see how each letter
    appears in a certain typeface.</p>

    <!--Oh, hi there source code snooper! As a kid, I always wondered why that sentence would
    display when I double-clicked a font file in Windows-->
    
    <h2>Totally Creative Domain Name</h2>
    <p>So, I searched for the least creative domain one could think of on the website "www.namecheap.com". 
    And that domain would be "CMWEB110.COM". And what do you know? It's available! And according to the 
    site, purchasing it will cost about US$8.88 per year.</p>

    <p>In actuality, I do have several domains I want to buy in the future, but I'm afraid to search for 
    them because I'm worried some sketchy people have written scripts that purchases recenlty searched for 
    domain names and buy them so they can sell it for large sum. I've seen it happen before. So, I only look
    up domains when I'm ready to buy on the spot! Just my two cents.</p>

    <h2>Oh, Baby, What a Plan!</h2>
    <p>Okay, so I looked up the hosting plans available for individuals at https://www.hostgator.com/web-hosting, 
    as required by this assignment, and to my surprise (albeit a pleasent one), the names of the different 
    tiers of plans are adorable. :)</p>

    <p>So, the two lowest tiered hosting plans on Hostgator is the "Hatchling Plan" and the "Baby Plan". And 
    the next tier up is called, simply, the "Business Plan". From the looks of it, I like the "Baby Plan", 
    and not just because of it's name (well a little). For just over a dollar more than the "Hatchling Plan" 
    I am able to have unlimited domains rather than having a single domain. The added flexibility makes this 
    a lot more valuable. On the other hand I really don't need dedicated IP or SEO tools any time soon; so, 
    I can pass on the "Business Plan" and save a few bucks!</p>
