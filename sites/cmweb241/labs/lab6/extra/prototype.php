📖 Additional Information
---------------------------
Below are some general documentation that applies to this and other CMWEB webpage source codes. Contextual documentation on specefic features or layout may be available in-line with the code.

💡 Terminology 
----------------
Daisy: the term "Daisy" may be used to indicate the client device that is rendering the webpage. E.g. files stored on "Daisy” vs files stored on server”.

It may be used in names of variables that relate specefically to the end-device. For instance, a variable that holds the content to be read aloud by the device may have "Daisy" in its name (as in “Daisy” will speak the following text).

Other examples: "Daisy set to silent", "Daisy on airplane mode", "Daisy will execute this javascript if...", etc.

    ****

Cordelia: The term "Cordelia" may be used when referring to the server. Variables with this designation may be used in pages containing PHP or any other server side code.
